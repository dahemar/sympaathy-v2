Currently Berlin based. A tender, visceral and hallucinatory vaporization of sounds and feelings, an exploration of solitude amidst a hyper connected reality.

Composed of ErmenX aka Gabi Pedrosa and St. Diamantista VII, the duo experiments with perspectives. Their eclectic style emerges from bewitched swamps, between heightened indie-folk and post-metal, .pastoral adopts guitars, vocals, drums, sound collage and other instruments to tell narratives that are both tender and grotesque, inhabited by sensitive melodies and desperate incantations. They have released two albums on their label ruego; funeral perpetuo del espíritu (2019) and un corazón mustio y marchito por culpa de las tribulaciones y los padecimientos (2022).</p>"}],"contactLinks":[{"order":1,"label":"diamantistavii@gmail.com","href":"mailto:diamantistavii@gmail.com","is_external":true},{"order":2,"label":"@prenatal_amygdala","href":"https://www.instagram.com/prenatal_amygdala/","is_external":true}]}
